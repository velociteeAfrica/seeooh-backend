# SEEOOH API

This is the SEEOOH Application Backend built with [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If the output is not the version of your nodejs installation, install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After installing nodejs install [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
if you have it then install the project's dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## STARTING THE SERVER

To start the application server

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4500](http://localhost:4500/status) with your browser to see the result.

### **Building**

```bash
yarn build
```

## Editor setup

We're using eslint for js linting, and prettier for code formating, make sure you install eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can
see linting errors as you code and have your code formatted on save by prettier. If formatOnSave doesn't work please google how to set up
format on save for the eslint & prettier plugins in your editor ðŸ™ƒ
